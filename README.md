# Project Description

We've all used websites that tell us what video game character we're most like based on our personality or, more commonly, what type of learner we are. Buzzfeed and countless other website use questionare's that users answer and out pops an answer. To be able to understand the basics of asking users questions and giving a result, I'm using this project to better understand the code behind these questionaires. Instead of personality tests, I used coding questions that a hiring developer could use during an interviewing process.
